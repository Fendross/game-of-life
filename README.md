# **GAME OF LIFE**

A basic implementation of Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using pygame and numpy.

## **How it works**

The game starts with an empty grid (2D array). The user can click with the mouse on the various cells and turn them alive, creating different kinds of shapes. When the user is ready and presses the space bar, the simulation starts running and cells either keep on living, die or come to life depending on how many alive / dead neighbors they have.

## **How to run the program**

Make sure to have **python** and **pip** installed.
Then, simply navigate to a new folder and execute the following commands in order (swap 'pip3, python3' for 'pip, python' if on Windows):

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Fendross/game-of-life.git .
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
